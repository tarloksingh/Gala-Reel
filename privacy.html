Lovetap is a product released by Openup Technologies. We are committed to protecting your privacy and limiting the data we collect to only what’s necessary to provide a safe and fun experience. This policy explains what data we collect, how we use and share it, and your rights.

Data Collection and Use
Account Data
We do not collect personal identifiers such as phone numbers, gender, or age.

Device and App Activity Data
We collect limited technical information from your device (like device type, operating system, IP address, and anonymous identifiers) and how you use the app (like session duration and activity). This helps us improve Lovetap, fix bugs, and ensure a smooth experience for all users.

How We Disclose Data
We do not sell, rent, or share your data for advertising purposes. We may disclose information to the following:

Service Providers – like cloud hosting, analytics providers, or crash reporting tools that help us run and improve the app.

Professional Advisors – including legal and financial advisors as needed.

Business Transaction Recipients – such as during a merger, acquisition, or other business changes.

Legal and Safety – when required by law or to protect the rights, safety, or property of Lovetap users or others.

Data Retention
We keep your data only as long as necessary to provide the services in Lovetap and to comply with legal obligations. If your account becomes inactive, we may delete or anonymize your data after a reasonable period.

Your Rights
All users of Lovetap have the following rights:

Deactivate – you can remove your profile from the app.

Access – you may request a copy of your app data if legally required.

Delete – you may request deletion of your data, subject to certain legal exceptions.

Correct – you may request we fix incorrect profile data.

Stop Processing – you may ask us to stop using your data.

Object – you may object to how we process certain data.

Complain – you may file a complaint with your local data protection authority, if applicable.

To exercise these rights, contact us at (682) 552-9882. Please include your username and device type to help us process your request. If you're acting through an agent, we may ask you to verify your identity and confirm authorization.

Do Not Track Signals
Your browser or device may offer a “Do Not Track” signal or opt-out preference. Lovetap is not designed to respond to these signals, and we do not use your data for targeted advertising.

Changes to This Policy
We may update this privacy policy as our platform evolves or as laws change. If we make significant updates, we’ll post them in the app or notify you directly.
